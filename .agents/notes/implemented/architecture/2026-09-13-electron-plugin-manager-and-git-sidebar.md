# Agent Note: Electron remounts Plugin Manager and composes Git through sidebarRight

Status: implemented

English | [中文](2026-09-13-electron-plugin-manager-and-git-sidebar.zh.md)

## Problem

The 0.1.5-rc.2 pin left Plugin Manager and Git uncomposed because Git occupied the removed Client `details` slot ([Git unmount](2026-09-13-electron-unmount-git-plugin.md)). `settings.plugins.tab` still exists, so the Installed tab could remount without Details Host. Git needed a Sidebar port before it could return to `dshElectron.ecosystemPlugins`.

## Decision

`apps/electron/runtime/host.patch.yml` inserts `@dsh-electron/dsh-electron-ui-plugin-manager`.

`@dsh-electron/dsh-plugin-git@0.2.1` injects `sidebarRight` / `sidebarRightTabs` and has no runtime dependency on `details`, `shellDetails`, or `@dsh-electron/dsh-client-ui-details-host`. Desktop lists the package in `dshElectron.ecosystemPlugins` and keeps its exact production npm dependency under the [npm-only ecosystem plugin rule](2026-09-14-electron-npm-only-ecosystem-plugins.md).

## Alternatives considered

**Remount Details Host so the previous Git client could load.** Rejected because upstream still has no `details` slot.

**Remount Plugin Manager while leaving Git uncomposed after the Sidebar port landed.** Rejected because the port is details-free and `sync-version` can keep the production dependency.

**Delete the Details Host tree.** Rejected at the time because subtree identity remained useful while the slot was absent. The mirror is since deleted ([removal note](2026-09-13-electron-remove-details-host.md)).

## Consequences

Desktop Settings shows the Installed tab. Git UI lives in the right sidebar. Overlay tests require Plugin Manager in the bootstrap patch. Git remains absent from `host.patch.yml` because ecosystem composition uses the generated include file.
