# DeepSeek Harness Desktop

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

This application packages the upstream DeepSeek Harness as a native desktop shell. Electron Main supervises the built `dsh web` backend on a loopback port for compatibility, while `BrowserWindow` loads an Electron-owned renderer from `dsh-electron://localhost/` built inside this package from `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-web`. Host bootstrap, plugin bundles, unary `/api` calls, and event streams reach the supervised process only through Main (typed preload IPC and the custom-scheme protocol proxy). Profiles, sessions, and `$DSH_HOME` storage remain the upstream Harness behavior.

Detailed CURRENT vs TARGET architecture, ownership rules, milestones, and ADRs live in [../../docs/electron/architecture.md](../../docs/electron/architecture.md).

## Architecture (CURRENT)

Desktop separates three layers:

| Layer | Owns |
| ----- | ---- |
| Electron Runtime | Window/tray/menu/updater, OS privileges, security policy, Host process supervision, packaging |
| DeepSeek Harness | Agents, sessions, tools, models, profiles, Cordis Host/client runtime, persistence |
| Feature plugins | Independent downstream product UI (preferred home for new Desktop features) |

Process topology:

```text
BrowserWindow (dsh-electron://localhost)
  └─ Electron-owned Renderer → @deepseek-ai/dsh-client-web
Electron Main
  ├─ typed window.deepseekDesktop bridge (no generic IPC)
  └─ supervised `dsh web` on 127.0.0.1:<random-port>
```

Governing rules for contributors:

- Desktop-only work stays under `apps/electron/**`; do not customize Desktop UI through `apps/web`.
- Keep `src/renderer` a thin bootstrap/carrier; do not grow a second product frontend there.
- Independent product features SHOULD be DSH/Cordis plugins under `runtime/plugins/`; Host composition stays explicit in `runtime/host.patch.yml`.
- Feature plugins consume native behavior through the `ctx.desktop` capability service (Desktop Capability Provider), not direct `window.deepseekDesktop` access.
- Loopback Host transport is an internal compatibility mechanism, not a defect to remove without evidence.

## Development

Use Node.js and pnpm versions declared by the repository. Build the upstream runtime before starting Electron:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run build
pnpm --filter @dsh-electron/dsh-electron start
```

`pnpm --filter @dsh-electron/dsh-electron build` compiles the main process, preload bridge, bundled runtime plugins, and renderer (`dist/renderer`). Focused desktop tests expect those Electron artifacts (after the upstream `pnpm run build` above):

```sh
pnpm --filter @dsh-electron/dsh-electron build
pnpm --filter @dsh-electron/dsh-electron test
```

## Desktop integration

The main window uses a hidden title bar without a separate heading row. The sidebar and conversation backgrounds extend to the window top: macOS reserves a draggable sidebar inset for its traffic lights, while the Windows and Linux sidebar content starts at the top edge because their Window Controls Overlay occupies only the top-right corner. Unused parts of the active conversation header are draggable, and a transparent 40-pixel hit surface covers the empty-session background. Header controls, dialog masks, and full-viewport dialogs are explicitly non-draggable. Closing the main window hides it while the Harness process continues running. Use the tray menu to reopen the window or quit the application and stop the supervised process.

OS desktop capabilities are owned by Electron Main and exposed through the typed `window.deepseekDesktop` preload bridge. The Desktop Capability Provider plugin (`runtime/plugins/desktop-capabilities`) adapts that bridge into `ctx.desktop` for feature plugins. The supervised Host receives an `apps/electron/runtime` cordis overlay that disables Host `directory-picker-auto`, keeps the browse Host backend so `directoryPicker` still injects for apiproxy, mounts the capability provider, and mounts an Electron-local directory-flow client plugin (no browse client), so Windows no longer uses the Koffi native picker worker. Bundled runtime plugins are built by `scripts/build-runtime-plugins.mjs` and linked into `$DSH_HOME/profiles/node_modules` at startup. Upstream UI clipboard writes are redirected through a narrow renderer shim to Main until an upstream injection seam exists. External URLs opened as new windows must use `https:`, `http:`, or `mailto:`.

The native page context menu exposes cut, copy, paste, select all, and reload according to Chromium's current editing capabilities; development builds also expose DevTools. The application menu and tray menu provide the desktop-owned About window, update channel selection, and manual update check.

The tray uses a monochrome DeepSeek glyph rasterized from the tracked `assets/tray/deepseek.svg` (LobeHub lobe-icons, MIT). `pnpm run build:tray` emits per-DPI PNGs under `build/tray/`; Windows and Linux select a black glyph for a light native theme and a white glyph for a dark native theme at the nearest packaged pixel size for the primary display scale factor, refreshing when Electron reports a theme or display-metrics change. macOS uses pre-rasterized template PNGs so the operating system controls menu-bar contrast.

The About window reads the repository URL from this package manifest, displays the packaged icon and version, and opens the project link in the system browser. Its renderer is sandboxed and its Content Security Policy admits only its embedded styles and icon.

## Updates

Packaged builds default to the **Pre-Release** channel and persist the selected channel in Electron's user-data directory. The application and tray menus can switch between **Pre-Release**, which receives the newest published prerelease or stable release, and **Stable / Release**, which uses GitHub's latest production release and never selects a prerelease. Channel selection uses GitHub Release metadata for tags such as `v0.1.0-beta.1`, `v0.1.0-rc.3`, and `v0.1.0`; `electron-updater` still owns metadata validation, semantic-version comparison, download, and installation.

The menus show checking and download progress, then offer a restart after the update is ready. Manual checks report whether no update exists or a download started. A failed check writes the complete error to the main-process log while its dialog contains only network and retry guidance.

`electron-builder` emits `latest.yml`, `latest-mac.yml`, architecture-specific Linux metadata, and blockmaps. The desktop release workflow merges per-architecture metadata before uploading it with the installers so one GitHub Release serves x64 and ARM64 clients. macOS auto-update installation requires signed packages; the repository's unsigned CI artifacts exercise metadata generation and download discovery but require signing credentials before trusted distribution.

## Packaging

The package metadata declares `DeepSeek Harness` as its product name, which Electron and `electron-builder` use for development chrome, application metadata, installers, and executables. Packaged metadata uses the unscoped `deepseek-harness-desktop` application name so updater cache directories never derive from the workspace-only `@dsh-electron/dsh-electron` name. The package configuration emits an assisted NSIS installer on Windows that lets users choose the installation directory and uses ZIP payload extraction so NSIS rejects a failed extraction instead of installing only the uninstaller, plus DMG and ZIP artifacts on macOS and AppImage and DEB artifacts on Linux. The release workflow builds every format for x64 and ARM64 on native GitHub-hosted runners; each Windows runner installs its completed artifact, verifies the executable, runtime, and both shortcuts, then uninstalls it before upload. CI builds unsigned artifacts because repository signing credentials are not required; operators who distribute trusted binaries must provide the platform signing environment supported by `electron-builder`.

Desktop releases use `v{a.b.c}-beta.{x}` on `develop`, `v{a.b.c}-rc.{x}` on `main`, and `v{a.b.c}` for stable releases. [`sync-upstream.yml`](../../.github/workflows/sync-upstream.yml) merges upstream into `develop`, prepares and pushes the next Beta commit, and publishes its tag only after Desktop CI succeeds for that exact commit. Before opening the `develop` to `main` promotion pull request, run `pnpm electron:set-version <apps/cli version>` followed by `pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile`, then commit the Electron manifest and lockfile. Desktop CI rejects a promotion from another branch, a Beta version, or a version that differs from [`apps/cli/package.json`](../cli/package.json). After the pull request merges, [`desktop-promote.yml`](../../.github/workflows/desktop-promote.yml) creates the RC or Stable tag on the prepared `main` commit without changing either branch. [`desktop-release.yml`](../../.github/workflows/desktop-release.yml) validates the tag branch and package version before publishing installers.

## Runtime and security

The supervised Harness process binds only to `127.0.0.1` on a random port and is never the BrowserWindow page origin. The renderer has no Node.js integration, runs with context isolation and Chromium sandboxing, receives the typed `window.deepseekDesktop` bridge only, and cannot navigate away from `dsh-electron://localhost`. HTTP and HTTPS links requested as new windows open in the system browser.

The supervised process receives `$DSH_HOME` as `.dsh` below the operating-system user home, so Harness profiles, settings, sessions, and other state use `~/.dsh` on macOS and Linux or `%USERPROFILE%\.dsh` on Windows. Electron keeps its Chromium data, caches, and desktop update preference in its platform-specific `userData` directory. Agent shell commands use the current user's home directory as their initial workspace; users can select another workspace through the Harness UI.
